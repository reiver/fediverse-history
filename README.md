# Fediverse History
by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

This is a **history of the Fediverse**.

## Caveat

A **history of the Fediverse**, like any written _history_ of _anything_, will ignore most of the actually happen, and for-the-most-part focus on what the author (who wrote that history) was aware of and felt was significant and noteworthy.

Someone else (other than me) who may have written a **history of the Fediverse** may or may not focus on other events, that they consider significant and noteworthy enough to write about.

But (like anyone who might attempt this), even if I interview others for information, I can only write this **history of the Fediverse** from my perspective.
And focus on the events that №1 I was aware of, and №2 I think are significant.

Having said that — anyone (including me), who tries to write about the world, will bring with them their own personal life-history, and see things through that lens.
Please keep that in mind as you read this (or anything else) about the **history of the Fediverse**.
